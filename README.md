# Projects

**[Python-Based Video Game Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/nathanielliganor/Video-Game-Recommendation)**

This dynamic application collects user inputs on specific game attributes along with information on their mental health conditions. By analyzing this data, TheraGame delivers tailored suggestions of video games aimed at providing mental health relief.

#

**[SQL Database Design and Management for Future Electric Vehicle Data Analysis](https://github.com/nathanielliganor/EV-Insights)**

A robust SQL database for future electric vehicle data analysis. Skills applied include data modeling and normalization for efficient database design and data manipulation for handling EV information. This project enhanced my problem solving abilities in facing data challenges and broadened my understanding of EV diversity.

#

**[R-Based Analysis of Electric Vehicle Performance Statistics](https://github.com/nathanielliganor/behindthespeed/blob/master/ProjectAnalysis.pdf)**

Implemented an in-depth R-based analysis exploring correlation between electric vehicle brands and performance statistics. Conducted hypothesis testing to compare premium brand models and top speeds. Utilized methods to create data distributions and employed statistical analysis for data comprehension.

#

**[A Contextual Inquiry into Michigan's Aging Water Infrastructure and Proposing Sustainable Solutions](https://github.com/nathanielliganor/contextual-inquiry)**

Conducted in-depth inquiry-based research, focusing on the significant challenges associated with Michigan's aging water infrastructure, such as public awareness, misinformation, and risk communication. The outcomes included detailed insights into societal consequences, offering robust recommendations like developing comprehensive community education, enhancing proactive communication, and enabling diversified stakeholder collaboration for a sustainable water infrastructure.

## Classification Problems

**[Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/nathanielliganor/Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Spaceship_Titanic.ipynb)**

Spaceship Titanic is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. As a part of my machine learning coursework in Data Manipulation course, I applied my machine learning knowledge and entered this competition. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on Kaggle. Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

## Visualization Projects

**[American Asylum Tableau Visualizations](https://github.com/nathanielliganor/static-viz-project/tree/main)**

In enhacning the New York Times article "Asylum in America, by the Numbers," I utilized Tableau to create impactful visualizations that provide deeper insight and context. Expanded my Tableau skill set, focusing on data preparation, visual analytics, and storytelling.
